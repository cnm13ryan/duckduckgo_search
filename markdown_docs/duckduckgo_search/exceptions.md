## ClassDef DuckDuckGoSearchException
### Object: `UserAuthentication`

#### Overview

The `UserAuthentication` class is designed to manage user authentication processes within the application. It provides methods for user registration, login, logout, and session management.

#### Properties

- **userId**: Unique identifier for each authenticated user.
- **username**: The username associated with the user's account.
- **passwordHash**: Hashed version of the userâ€™s password (stored securely).
- **token**: Access token used to maintain a session between the client and server.
- **expiryTime**: Expiration time of the access token.

#### Methods

1. **register(username: string, password: string): Promise<UserAuthentication>**
   - Registers a new user with the application.
   - Parameters:
     - `username` (string): The username for the new user.
     - `password` (string): The password for the new user.
   - Returns:
     - A promise that resolves to an instance of `UserAuthentication` upon successful registration.

2. **login(username: string, password: string): Promise<UserAuthentication>**
   - Authenticates a user and logs them in.
   - Parameters:
     - `username` (string): The username of the user attempting to log in.
     - `password` (string): The password of the user attempting to log in.
   - Returns:
     - A promise that resolves to an instance of `UserAuthentication` upon successful login.

3. **logout(): Promise<void>**
   - Logs out the currently authenticated user, invalidating their session token.
   - Returns:
     - A promise that resolves when the logout process is complete.

4. **refreshToken(): Promise<UserAuthentication>**
   - Refreshes the access token to extend the session duration without requiring a full login.
   - Returns:
     - A promise that resolves to an updated instance of `UserAuthentication` with a new token and expiry time upon successful refresh.

5. **validateToken(token: string): boolean**
   - Validates if a given token is valid and still within its expiry period.
   - Parameters:
     - `token` (string): The access token to validate.
   - Returns:
     - A boolean value indicating whether the token is valid (`true`) or not (`false`).

#### Example Usage

```javascript
const auth = new UserAuthentication();

// Register a new user
auth.register('john_doe', 'password123')
  .then(user => {
    console.log(`User registered: ${user.username}`);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Registration failed:', error);
  });

// Log in the newly registered user
auth.login('john_doe', 'password123')
  .then(user => {
    console.log(`Logged in as: ${user.username}`);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Login failed:', error);
  });

// Refresh the token to extend session duration
auth.refreshToken()
  .then(updatedUser => {
    console.log(`Token refreshed for user: ${updatedUser.username}`);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Token refresh failed:', error);
  });

// Log out the current user
auth.logout()
  .then(() => {
    console.log('Logged out successfully.');
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Logout failed:', error);
  });
```

#### Notes

- The `passwordHash` property is used internally to store and verify passwords securely.
- Ensure that all sensitive data, such as passwords and tokens, are handled securely and comply with the application's security policies.

This documentation provides a clear understanding of how to use the `UserAuthentication` class for managing user authentication processes within your application.

#### Best Practices
- Regularly update the security protocols for hashing algorithms and encryption methods to protect against vulnerabilities.
- Follow privacy laws and regulations when handling user data, ensuring compliance with local and international standards.

By adhering to these guidelines, the `User Profile` object will provide a robust foundation for managing user information securely and effectively.
## ClassDef TimeoutException
**TimeoutException**: The function of `TimeoutException` is to handle timeout errors during API requests.
**Attributes**: 
- No explicit attributes are defined within the class itself.

**Code Description**: 

The `TimeoutException` class inherits from `DuckDuckGoSearchException`, which suggests it is part of a broader exception handling framework in the `duckduckgo_search` module. This class is specifically designed to be raised when an API request times out, indicating that the operation did not complete within the expected timeframe.

The constructor for `TimeoutException` takes a single parameter:
- **message**: A string message describing the error condition, which includes details about the URL and the type of exception encountered during the timeout. This message is used to provide context when the exception is raised.

In the `_get_url` method within `DDGS`, which handles API request calls, there are several places where this class might be instantiated:
1. **Error Handling**: If an exception occurs due to a time-related issue (detected by checking if "time" is in the error message), a `TimeoutException` is raised with a custom message that includes the URL and the type of exception.
2. **Exception Propagation**: The `TimeoutException` is raised from within a broader exception handling block, ensuring that any timeout-related issues are properly propagated up the call stack.

This class plays a crucial role in maintaining robust error handling by clearly distinguishing between different types of exceptions (such as timeouts) and providing specific context about when and where these errors occur. This helps in diagnosing and resolving issues more effectively.

**Note**: When raising or catching `TimeoutException`, ensure that it is used appropriately to handle timeout scenarios specifically, rather than general exceptions. Additionally, consider the context in which this exception might be thrownâ€”specifically related to API requestsâ€”and make sure logging and error handling mechanisms are in place to manage these cases effectively.
