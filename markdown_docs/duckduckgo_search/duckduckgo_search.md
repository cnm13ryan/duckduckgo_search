### FunctionDef __init__(self, headers, proxy, proxies, timeout, verify)
**__init__**: The function of __init__ is to initialize the DDGS object with necessary configurations.

**parameters**:
· headers (dict[str, str] | None): Optional dictionary of headers for the HTTP client. Defaults to None.
· proxy (str | None): Optional proxy string for the HTTP client, supporting http/https/socks5 protocols. Example: "http://user:pass@example.com:3128". Defaults to None.
· proxies (dict[str, str] | str | None): Optional dictionary or string of proxies; deprecated in favor of `proxy`. Defaults to None.
· timeout (int | None): Optional timeout value for the HTTP client. Defaults to 10 seconds.

**Code Description**: The __init__ method sets up the DDGS object with initial configurations required for making HTTP requests. It initializes several key attributes:

- **Headers Configuration**: If headers are provided, they are stored in a local variable `_headers`, which will be used when sending HTTP requests.
- **Proxy Setup**: A proxy is configured based on the value of `proxy`. If the `proxy` parameter is set to "tb", it automatically expands this to a full socks5 proxy URL ("socks5://127.0.0.1:9150"). Otherwise, the provided string or None is used directly.
- **Timeout Setting**: The `timeout` value is stored in `_timeout`, which defines how long requests will wait before timing out.

The method also configures additional attributes:
- **User-Agent String**: A default user-agent string is set to identify the client making HTTP requests. This can be overridden if needed.
- **Request URL Base**: If a base URL is provided, it is stored in `_base_url` for use when constructing full URLs for API calls.

The method ensures that all necessary configurations are in place before any HTTP requests are made, providing a robust starting point for the DDGS object. It also handles deprecated parameters gracefully by converting them to more modern and efficient configurations.

**Note**: The `proxies` parameter is now considered deprecated and should be replaced with the `proxy` parameter if possible. This ensures consistency in configuration and simplifies future maintenance of the codebase.
***
### FunctionDef __enter__(self)
**__enter__**: The function of __enter__ is to allow the class instance to be used as a context manager.

**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.
· parameter1: None

**Code Description**: 
The `__enter__` method is defined here, which is part of Python's context management protocol. It is called when entering a with statement using an object that has both `__enter__` and `__exit__` methods. In this case, the method returns the instance itself (`self`). This allows the `DDGS` class to be used as a context manager, enabling operations such as setting up resources or configurations before executing code within a specific block.

The implementation is straightforward:
- The method takes no parameters.
- It simply returns the instance of the class (`self`).

This method is typically paired with another special method called `__exit__`, which is responsible for cleaning up resources after the block of code inside the `with` statement has executed. However, in this case, only `__enter__` is provided, implying that resource cleanup might be handled elsewhere.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `DDGS` class also implements the `__exit__` method to properly manage any resources or clean up after the context block.
- The return value of `__enter__` should be used as the context manager object within the with statement, allowing for easy access to methods and attributes of the instance during the execution of the block.

**Output Example**: 
```python
with DDGS() as ddgs:
    # Code executed in the context
    results = ddgs.search("Python documentation")
```
In this example, `DDGS().__enter__()` returns the instance itself, which is then assigned to the variable `ddgs`. The methods and attributes of the `ddgs` object can be accessed within the block of code under the `with` statement.
***
### FunctionDef __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb)
**__exit__**: The function of __exit__ is to handle cleanup actions during the exit from a context.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: exc_type (type[BaseException] | None) - This parameter represents the type of exception that was raised, or it can be `None` if no exception occurred.
· parameter2: exc_val (BaseException | None) - This parameter is the actual instance of the exception, or it can be `None` if no exception occurred.
· parameter3: exc_tb (TracebackType | None) - This parameter represents the traceback object associated with the exception, or it can be `None` if no exception occurred.

**Code Description**: The __exit__ method is part of Python's context management protocol and is used to perform necessary cleanup actions when exiting a context. It is called automatically by the with statement when the block inside the with statement is exited normally or due to an exception.

In this implementation, the method does not contain any specific logic and simply returns `None`. This indicates that no resources need to be cleaned up in this particular case or that the cleanup has already been handled elsewhere. The parameters are defined according to the standard context management protocol:

- `exc_type` is used to determine the type of exception (if any) that was raised.
- `exc_val` holds the actual instance of the exception, which can be useful for logging or performing specific cleanup based on the exception type.
- `exc_tb` provides a traceback object, which can help in diagnosing issues by showing where the exception occurred.

This method is typically overridden to include custom cleanup logic such as closing files, releasing locks, or other resources that need to be freed when exiting a context. The absence of any code within this function suggests that no specific cleanup actions are required for the current implementation of DDGS.

**Note**: Although the __exit__ method does not contain any explicit cleanup logic in this example, it is essential to ensure that all necessary cleanup operations are defined and executed properly when overriding this method. Developers should always implement proper resource management practices to avoid memory leaks or other issues that could arise from improper handling of resources.
***
### FunctionDef parser(self)
**parser**: The function of parser is to return an HTML parser configured with specific settings.
**parameters**: This Function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The `parser` method returns an instance of `LHTMLParser`, which is used for parsing HTML content. The method configures the parser with several options:
- `remove_blank_text=True`: Removes blank text nodes from the parsed document, ensuring that only significant text is retained.
- `remove_comments=True`: Eliminates HTML comments from the parsed document to reduce noise and improve readability.
- `remove_pis=True`: Removes processing instructions (PIs) from the parsed document. Processing instructions are typically used for server-side scripting or other non-standard purposes and can be safely removed in many cases.
- `collect_ids=False`: Disables collecting element IDs during parsing, which can save memory but may affect certain use cases that require tracking of specific elements by their ID.

This method is called by the `_text_html_page` and `_text_lite_page` methods within the `DDGS` class. These methods utilize the parser to extract relevant information from the HTML responses received from DuckDuckGo's search results pages or lite mode results. The parsers are essential for extracting titles, URLs, and bodies of search result snippets.

**Note**: Ensure that the `LHTMLParser` is correctly imported and available in your environment. Also, be aware that disabling ID collection might impact certain functionalities that rely on specific element IDs.

**Output Example**: 
The output of this method would be an instance of `LHTMLParser` configured with the specified options:
```python
parser = parser()
# Output: <lxml.html.parser.LHtmlParser object at 0x7f8b4c3a9e10>
```
This parser can then be used to parse HTML content as needed.

### FunctionDef _text_lite(self, keywords, region, timelimit, max_results)
**_text_lite**: The function of _text_lite is to perform a DuckDuckGo text search using the lite backend.

**Parameters**:
· keywords: str - The keywords for the query.
· region: str = "wt-wt" - The region parameter, which can be one of several predefined values like "wt-wt", "us-en", "uk-en", etc. Defaults to "wt-wt".
· timelimit: str | None = None - A string representing a time limit for the search results (d, w, m, y). If not provided, no time limit is applied.
· max_results: int | None = None - The maximum number of results to return. If not provided or set to `None`, only results from the first response are returned.

**Code Description**: 
The `_text_lite` function performs a DuckDuckGo text search using the lite backend, which scrapes data from the "lite.duckduckgo.com" URL. It takes several parameters like keywords, region, timelimit, and max_results to customize the search query. The function first validates that `keywords` are provided and then constructs a payload dictionary with these parameters.

The function uses an iterative approach to collect results by repeatedly making requests until either the maximum number of results is reached or no more pages are available. It processes each response, extracting relevant information such as title, URL, and summary text from the search results. The extracted data is stored in a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a single result.

The function also handles potential errors by catching exceptions that may occur during the request process. If an error occurs, it raises specific exceptions like `RatelimitException` or `TimeoutException`, which are subclasses of `DuckDuckGoSearchException`.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that `lxml` is installed if you plan to use the "lite" backend, as it may be required for parsing HTML content.
- The function relies on the availability of the lite backend and may behave differently or fail if this backend is not accessible.

**Output Example**: 
The output will be a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains information about a search result. For example:
```python
[
    {
        "title": "Example Title 1",
        "url": "https://example.com/1",
        "summary": "This is the summary for the first result."
    },
    {
        "title": "Example Title 2",
        "url": "https://example.com/2",
        "summary": "This is the summary for the second result."
    }
]
```

   - Status is updated accordingly (e.g., In Progress, Resolved).

4. **Closeout:**
   - Once the issue is resolved, tickets are marked as "Resolved" and closed.
   - Historical data can be reviewed for future reference.

#### Best Practices
- Regularly update ticket statuses to reflect current progress.
- Maintain clear and concise notes in `ResolutionNotes` for transparency.
- Use attachments judiciously to include relevant supporting materials.

By adhering to these guidelines, organizations can ensure effective management of customer service tickets, leading to improved customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

### `__init__(self)`

**Description:**
Constructor method to initialize the `DataProcessor` object. No parameters are required for initialization.

**Example Usage:**
```python
processor = DataProcessor()
```

### `load_data(self, file_path: str, format: str) -> DataFrame`

**Description:**
Loads data from a specified file path and in a specified format (e.g., CSV, JSON).

**Parameters:**
- `file_path` (str): The path to the data file.
- `format` (str): The format of the data file (supported formats include "CSV", "JSON").

**Returns:**
- `DataFrame`: A pandas DataFrame containing the loaded data.

**Example Usage:**
```python
data = processor.load_data("path/to/data.csv", "CSV")
```

### `clean_data(self, df: DataFrame) -> DataFrame`

**Description:**
Cleans and preprocesses a given DataFrame by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and converting data types where necessary.

**Parameters:**
- `df` (DataFrame): The input DataFrame to be cleaned.

**Returns:**
- `DataFrame`: A cleaned DataFrame with the specified transformations applied.

**Example Usage:**
```python
cleaned_data = processor.clean_data(data)
```

### `transform_data(self, df: DataFrame) -> DataFrame`

**Description:**
Transforms a given DataFrame by applying feature engineering techniques such as scaling, encoding categorical variables, and creating new features.

**Parameters:**
- `df` (DataFrame): The input DataFrame to be transformed.

**Returns:**
- `DataFrame`: A transformed DataFrame with the specified transformations applied.

**Example Usage:**
```python
transformed_data = processor.transform_data(cleaned_data)
```

### `save_data(self, df: DataFrame, file_path: str, format: str) -> None`

**Description:**
Saves a given DataFrame to a specified file path in a specified format.

**Parameters:**
- `df` (DataFrame): The input DataFrame to be saved.
- `file_path` (str): The path where the data should be saved.
- `format` (str): The format of the output file (supported formats include "CSV", "JSON").

**Example Usage:**
```python
processor.save_data(transformed_data, "path/to/processed_data.csv", "CSV")
```
