## FunctionDef json_dumps(obj)
### Function Overview
**`json_dumps`**: This function serializes a Python object into a JSON-formatted string using `orjson` if available; otherwise, it falls back to the standard library's `json` module.

### Parameters
- **obj**: The Python object to be serialized. This parameter is of type `Any`, meaning it can accept any data type that is serializable.
  - **referencer_content**: True (The function is called by `_save_json` in `duckduckgo_search/cli.py`)
  - **reference_letter**: False (No internal components are called within this function)

### Return Values
- The function returns a JSON-formatted string representation of the input object.

### Detailed Explanation
The `json_dumps` function aims to serialize Python objects into JSON strings efficiently. It first checks if the `orjson` library is available (`HAS_ORJSON`). If true, it uses `orjson.dumps()` with options set for pretty printing (indentation level 2). The result from `orjson.dumps()` is a bytes object, which is then decoded to a string using `.decode()`. 

If `orjson` is not available, the function defaults to using Python's built-in `json.dumps()`, specifying `ensure_ascii=False` to allow non-ASCII characters and setting `indent=2` for pretty printing. This fallback ensures that serialization can proceed even if `orjson` is unavailable.

In case an exception occurs during the serialization process, it catches the exception and raises a `DuckDuckGoSearchException`, wrapping the original exception's type name and message.

### Relationship Description
- **Callers**: The function is called by `_save_json` in `duckduckgo_search/cli.py`. This indicates that `json_dumps` plays a role in preparing data for saving to JSON files.
- **Callees**: No other internal components are directly invoked within this function. It relies on external libraries (`orjson` and `json`) for its core functionality.

### Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions
- **Limitations**:
  - The function assumes that the input object is serializable by both `orjson` and `json`. If the object contains non-serializable types, an exception will be raised.
  
- **Edge Cases**:
  - When `orjson` is not available, the function falls back to `json.dumps()`, which may have different performance characteristics compared to `orjson`.
  - The function does not handle specific exceptions that might arise from serialization issues; it simply wraps and rethrows them as a `DuckDuckGoSearchException`.

- **Refactoring Suggestions**:
  - **Extract Method**: If the logic for handling exceptions becomes more complex, consider extracting this into a separate method to improve readability.
  - **Introduce Explaining Variable**: For clarity, introduce variables to store intermediate results such as the result of `orjson.dumps()` before decoding it. This can make the code easier to read and maintain.
  - **Replace Conditional with Polymorphism**: If additional serialization libraries are introduced in the future, consider using polymorphism to handle different serialization strategies rather than relying on conditionals.

By adhering to these guidelines and suggestions, the `json_dumps` function can be made more robust, readable, and maintainable.

## FunctionDef _extract_vqd(html_bytes, keywords)
### Function Overview
**_extract_vqd**: This function extracts a vqd (vertical query descriptor) value from HTML bytes based on specified keywords.

### Parameters
- **html_bytes**: The HTML content as bytes from which to extract the vqd. Type: `bytes`.
- **keywords**: The search keywords used in the request, relevant for error messaging if extraction fails. Type: `str`.

### Return Values
- Returns a string representing the extracted vqd value.

### Detailed Explanation
The `_extract_vqd` function aims to locate and extract a specific substring (vqd) from an HTML content provided as bytes. It does this by searching for predefined patterns that typically enclose the vqd value in the HTML document:
1. The function iterates over a tuple of tuples, each containing three elements: 
   - `c1`: A byte sequence marking the start of the vqd.
   - `c1_len`: The length of the starting byte sequence (`c1`).
   - `c2`: A byte sequence marking the end of the vqd.
2. For each pattern, it attempts to find the index of `c1` in `html_bytes`. If found, it calculates the start position of the vqd by adding `c1_len` to this index.
3. It then searches for the first occurrence of `c2` starting from the calculated start position to determine the end of the vqd.
4. The substring between these two indices is extracted and decoded from bytes to string, which is then returned as the vqd value.
5. If none of the patterns match (i.e., no valid vqd can be found), a `DuckDuckGoSearchException` is raised with an error message indicating the failure.

### Relationship Description
- **Referencer Content**: The function `_extract_vqd` is called by `_get_vqd` in `duckduckgo_search.py`. This indicates that `_extract_vqd` serves as a utility for extracting vqd values, which are necessary for constructing search queries.
- **Reference Letter**: The function raises an exception defined in `exceptions.py`, specifically `DuckDuckGoSearchException`.

### Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions
- **Error Handling**: The current error handling mechanism is straightforward but could be improved by providing more context about why the vqd extraction failed (e.g., malformed HTML, missing patterns).
- **Code Duplication**: The repeated pattern matching can be refactored to avoid redundancy. This can be achieved by using a loop over predefined patterns and extracting the logic into a separate function if necessary.
- **Readability**: Introducing explaining variables for complex expressions could improve readability. For example, `start_index` and `end_index` could be used instead of inline calculations.
- **Refactoring Techniques**:
  - **Extract Method**: Consider extracting the pattern matching logic into a helper method to simplify `_extract_vqd`.
  - **Introduce Explaining Variable**: Use variables like `start_index` and `end_index` to clarify the purpose of these values in the code.
  - **Replace Conditional with Polymorphism**: Although not directly applicable here, if additional patterns are introduced, polymorphism could be used to handle different cases more cleanly.

By applying these refactoring techniques, the function can become more maintainable, readable, and robust.
## FunctionDef _text_extract_json(html_bytes, keywords)
# Documentation for `_text_extract_json`

## Function Overview
**_text_extract_json** is a function designed to extract JSON data from HTML content. It specifically targets and parses a segment of HTML that contains structured JSON information.

## Parameters
- **html_bytes**: A bytes object representing the HTML content from which JSON data needs to be extracted.
  - **referencer_content**: This parameter indicates if there are references (callers) from other components within the project to this component. In this case, `_text_api_page` in `duckduckgo_search.py` calls `_text_extract_json`.
- **keywords**: A string representing the search keywords used for context or logging purposes.
  - **reference_letter**: This parameter shows if there is a reference to this component from other project parts, representing callees in the relationship. Here, `_text_api_page` is a callee.

## Return Values
The function returns a list of dictionaries containing parsed JSON data extracted from the specified segment of HTML content.

## Detailed Explanation
**_text_extract_json** operates by:
1. **Locating the JSON Segment**: It searches for a specific pattern in the HTML content to identify and isolate the JSON data.
2. **Extracting JSON Data**: Once located, it extracts this JSON data as a string.
3. **Parsing JSON**: The extracted JSON string is then parsed into a Python object using `json_loads`, which internally uses either `orjson` or Python's built-in `json` module depending on the availability of `orjson`.
4. **Returning Data**: Finally, it returns the parsed JSON data as a list of dictionaries.

## Relationship Description
- **Callers (referencer_content)**: `_text_extract_json` is called by `_text_api_page` in `duckduckgo_search.py`. This indicates that `_text_api_page` relies on `_text_extract_json` to process and extract structured data from HTML responses.
- **Callees (reference_letter)**: `_text_extract_json` calls `json_loads`, which is responsible for converting the JSON string into a Python object.

## Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions
### Limitations and Edge Cases
- **Error Handling**: The function relies on exception handling to manage parsing errors, but it does not provide specific error messages or recovery mechanisms.
- **Performance Considerations**: Using `orjson` if available can improve performance, but the function should ensure that `orjson` is installed and handle cases where it is not.

### Refactoring Suggestions
1. **Extract Method**:
   - The logic for locating and extracting the JSON segment could be refactored into a separate method to improve readability and modularity.
   
2. **Introduce Explaining Variable**:
   - Complex expressions, such as those used to locate the JSON segment in HTML, can be broken down using explaining variables to enhance clarity.

3. **Simplify Conditional Expressions**:
   - If there are any conditional checks within `json_loads`, consider using guard clauses to improve readability and reduce nesting.

4. **Encapsulate Collection**:
   - Ensure that the function does not expose internal collections directly; instead, return a copy or provide specific methods for accessing data.

5. **Enhance Error Handling**:
   - Provide more detailed error messages in exception handling to aid debugging and maintenance.
   
6. **Document Assumptions**:
   - Clearly document any assumptions about the structure of the HTML content and JSON data to help future maintainers understand the function's requirements.

By implementing these refactoring suggestions, the code can become more robust, easier to read, and maintainable, adhering to best practices in software development.
## FunctionDef _normalize(raw_html)
**Function Overview**: The `_normalize` function is designed to strip HTML tags from a given string and unescape any encoded characters.

**Parameters**:
- **raw_html (str)**: A string containing raw HTML content that needs to be normalized by removing HTML tags and unescaping entities. This parameter indicates if there are references (callers) from other components within the project to this component.
  - **referencer_content**: True, as `_normalize` is called by multiple functions in the `duckduckgo_search.py` file.
  - **reference_letter**: True, as `_normalize` processes and returns a modified version of its input string.

**Return Values**:
- The function returns a string with HTML tags removed and HTML entities unescaped.

**Detailed Explanation**:
The `_normalize` function operates by applying a regular expression to remove all HTML tags from the `raw_html` string. It then uses Python’s built-in `unescape` method from the `html` module to convert any HTML-encoded characters back into their original form. This two-step process ensures that the output is plain text, free of any HTML formatting or encoded entities.

**Relationship Description**:
- **Callers**: `_normalize` is invoked by several functions within the project, including `_news_page`, `_api_page`, and others (as seen in the provided references). These functions pass different pieces of raw HTML content to `_normalize` for processing.
- **Callees**: The function itself calls two external methods:
  - `re.sub(r'<[^>]+>', '', raw_html)`: This regular expression substitution removes all HTML tags from the input string.
  - `html.unescape(...)`: This method unescapes any HTML-encoded characters in the string.

**Usage Notes and Refactoring Suggestions**:
- **Limitations**: The function currently assumes that the input is a valid string. It does not handle non-string inputs gracefully, which could lead to errors if such cases occur.
- **Edge Cases**: Consider edge cases where `raw_html` might be an empty string or contain only HTML tags without any text content. In these scenarios, `_normalize` should return an empty string.
- **Refactoring Suggestions**:
  - **Guard Clauses**: Implement guard clauses to handle non-string inputs and improve error handling.
    ```python
    if not isinstance(raw_html, str):
        raise ValueError("Input must be a string")
    ```
  - **Extract Method**: If additional normalization steps are required in the future (e.g., removing special characters), consider extracting these into separate methods for better modularity.
  - **Introduce Explaining Variable**: For clarity, introduce an explaining variable to store the result of `re.sub` before unescaping:
    ```python
    stripped_html = re.sub(r'<[^>]+>', '', raw_html)
    return html.unescape(stripped_html)
    ```
- **Encapsulation**: Ensure that `_normalize` is encapsulated within a class if it becomes part of a larger system, allowing for easier maintenance and testing.

By adhering to these guidelines, the function can be made more robust, maintainable, and adaptable to future changes.
