## FunctionDef json_dumps(obj)
**json_dumps**: The function of `json_dumps` is to serialize Python objects into JSON formatted strings.
**Parameters**:
· obj: Any - The Python object to be serialized.

**Code Description**: 
The `json_dumps` function takes an input object and attempts to convert it into a JSON string. It first checks if the `orjson` library is available, which provides faster serialization with better formatting options. If `orjson` is present, it uses `orjson.dumps()` with indentation set to 2 spaces for pretty-printing. If `orjson` is not installed or available, it falls back to using Python's built-in `json.dumps()` method with similar settings.

Here is a detailed analysis:
- **Try Block**: The function attempts to serialize the input object.
  - **orjson Check**: It first checks if the `HAS_ORJSON` flag is set. If this flag indicates that `orjson` is available, it uses `orjson.dumps()` which is faster and provides better formatting options due to its optimized implementation.
  - **orjson Serialization**: If `orjson` is present, `orjson.dumps(obj, option=orjson.OPT_INDENT_2).decode()` is called. The `option=orjson.OPT_INDENT_2` ensures the JSON output is formatted with an indentation of two spaces for better readability.
  - **Fallback to json**: If `orjson` is not available or fails, it uses Python's built-in `json.dumps(obj, ensure_ascii=False, indent=2)` instead. The `ensure_ascii=False` parameter ensures that non-ASCII characters are correctly encoded in the JSON string.

- **Exception Handling**: If any exception occurs during serialization, a custom `DuckDuckGoSearchException` is raised with a detailed error message.
  - **Custom Exception**: This exception provides information about the type of exception and its details, which can be helpful for debugging issues related to object serialization.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `orjson` library is installed if you want to leverage its performance benefits. You can install it using `pip install orjson`.
- The function handles both ASCII and non-ASCII characters by setting `ensure_ascii=False`, making it suitable for internationalized data.
- The use of indentation in JSON output improves readability, especially when dealing with complex nested structures.

**Output Example**: 
If the input object is a Python dictionary like `{ "name": "John", "age": 30 }`, the function could return a string such as:
```json
{
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30
}
```
This example demonstrates how `json_dumps` converts a Python dictionary into a formatted JSON string.

# Logout example
logoutSuccess = UserAuthenticationService.Logout(userSession.SessionId)
if logoutSuccess:
    print("Logout successful.")
else:
    print("Failed to log out.")
```

#### Best Practices
- Always validate user credentials securely.
- Use secure protocols (e.g., HTTPS) for all authentication-related communications.
- Implement rate limiting and other security measures to prevent brute-force attacks.

#### Security Considerations
- Ensure that sensitive data, such as passwords and session tokens, are stored and transmitted securely.
- Regularly update dependencies and apply security patches to mitigate vulnerabilities.
- Follow best practices for secure coding and user management.
## FunctionDef _extract_vqd(html_bytes, keywords)
**_extract_vqd**: The function of _extract_vqd is to extract the vqd value from HTML bytes based on specific patterns.
**parameters**: 
· html_bytes: bytes - The HTML content as bytes from which the vqd needs to be extracted.
· keywords: str - The search keywords associated with the HTML content.

**Code Description**: The function `_extract_vqd` searches for the vqd value within a given block of HTML bytes. It looks for three different patterns to identify where the vqd might be located:
1. `vqd="` followed by 5 characters, then a closing quote.
2. `vqd=` followed by 4 characters, then an ampersand (`&`).
3. `vqd='` followed by 5 characters, then a single quote.

For each pattern, it calculates the start and end positions of the vqd value within the HTML bytes and returns this substring decoded as a string. If none of the patterns are found, it raises a `DuckDuckGoSearchException`.

The function is called from `_get_vqd` in `duckduckgo_search.py`, which performs an HTTP GET request to DuckDuckGo's search URL with specified keywords and then calls `_extract_vqd` to parse the response content for the vqd value.

**Note**: Ensure that the HTML bytes provided are correctly formatted and contain the expected patterns. If the vqd is not found, a `DuckDuckGoSearchException` will be raised, indicating that the search could not extract the required information.

**Output Example**: If the HTML content contains `<input type="hidden" value="1234567890">` and the pattern `vqd="` is matched, the function might return `"1234567890"` as a decoded string.

## FunctionDef _normalize(raw_html)
**_normalize**: The function of _normalize is to strip HTML tags from the raw_html string.
**Parameters**:
· parameter1: raw_html (str) - The input string containing HTML content that needs to be cleaned.

**Code Description**: 
The `_normalize` function takes a single parameter `raw_html`, which is expected to be an HTML content string. It uses the `REGEX_STRIP_TAGS` regular expression to remove all HTML tags from this string and returns the resulting text without any HTML markup. If the input `raw_html` is empty or None, it simply returns an empty string.

This function plays a crucial role in cleaning up the raw data fetched from various web sources before processing further. By stripping out unnecessary HTML tags, it ensures that only plain text remains, making it easier to handle and process for subsequent operations such as text extraction or display.

In the context of its callers:
- In `DDGS/_text_api/_text_api_page`, `_normalize` is used to clean up the extracted body content from search results. This ensures that any HTML tags within the body are removed, leaving only the textual content.
- Similarly, in `DDGS/_text_html/_text_html_page`, `_normalize` cleans the title and body text extracted from HTML elements, ensuring they are free of HTML tags before being included in the final result set.
- In `DDGS/news/_news_page`, `_normalize` is utilized to clean the excerpt (body) content of news articles, making sure that any embedded HTML is removed.

By consistently cleaning the data, `_normalize` helps maintain a uniform and standardized format across different types of input sources, enhancing the reliability and usability of the processed information.

**Note**: Ensure that `REGEX_STRIP_TAGS` is properly defined and configured to accurately match all necessary HTML tags. Any failure in this regex might lead to incomplete or incorrect text cleaning.

**Output Example**: 
If the input to `_normalize` is `<div><p>Hello, World!</p></div>`, the output will be `Hello, World!`. If the input is an empty string (`""`), the function returns an empty string.

            System.out.println("Password reset failed.");
        }
    }
}

#### Notes

- The `UserAuthentication` class uses dummy methods for password checking, hashing, and username existence checks. In a real application, these should be replaced with secure implementations.
- Passwords are stored as hashes to protect user data.
- The `isLoggedIn()` method can be used to check the authentication status of a session.

This documentation provides a clear understanding of how the `UserAuthentication` class operates and how it can be utilized within an application.
