## FunctionDef _download_file(url, dir_path, filename, proxy, verify)
**_download_file**: The function of _download_file is to download files from given URLs and save them locally.

**parameters**:
· parameter1: url - The URL of the file to be downloaded.
· parameter2: dir_path - The directory path where the file will be saved.
· parameter3: filename - The name of the file, which will be truncated to 200 characters if necessary.
· parameter4: proxy - A proxy server for making HTTP requests.
· parameter5: verify - Whether SSL certificates should be verified during HTTPS requests.

**Code Description**: 
The `_download_file` function is responsible for downloading files from specified URLs and saving them locally. It uses the `primp.Client` to make a GET request to the provided URL, handling the proxy settings and SSL verification as specified. If the response status code indicates success (HTTP 200), the content of the response is written into a file with the given filename in the specified directory path.

The function begins by creating an instance of `primp.Client` using the provided proxy details and other optional parameters such as impersonation and timeout. It then sends a GET request to the URL. If the response status code is 200 (indicating success), the content of the response is written into a file named with the first 200 characters of the given filename, truncated if necessary.

In case an exception occurs during the process, such as network issues or invalid URLs, the function catches the exception and logs it using `logger.debug`, providing details about the URL that failed to download along with the type and content of the exception. This logging helps in diagnosing issues and understanding why a particular file might not have been downloaded successfully.

**Note**: Ensure that the directory path exists before calling this function, as it will attempt to write files directly into the specified location without checking for its existence. Also, handle exceptions appropriately when using this function, especially if you are running multiple downloads in parallel or handling user input for filenames and URLs.

## FunctionDef cli
**cli**: The function of cli is to serve as the command-line interface (CLI) entry point for the duckduckgo_search tool.
**parameters**: This function does not accept any parameters directly.
**Code Description**: 
The `cli` function acts as the main entry point for the CLI interface of the duckduckgo_search tool. Although the provided code snippet only contains a placeholder with the docstring stating "dukduckgo_search CLI tool", it likely includes the logic to handle various commands and options that users can input through the command line.

This function is called by `safe_entry_point` in `cli.py`, which ensures that any exceptions raised during execution are caught and handled gracefully, preventing the program from crashing unexpectedly. This makes the CLI more robust and user-friendly.

The `cli` function is also indirectly tested in multiple test cases within the `test_cli.py` file. These tests cover various commands such as `version`, `chat`, `text`, `images`, `news`, `videos`, `maps`, `answers`, `suggestions`, and `translate`. Each test verifies that the expected output or behavior is produced when specific parameters are passed to the `cli` function.

**Note**: Ensure that all necessary dependencies for handling different commands (such as version, chat, text search, etc.) are correctly imported and configured within the `cli` function. Additionally, make sure that any required arguments or options are properly validated before processing them.
## FunctionDef safe_entry_point
**safe_entry_point**: The function of safe_entry_point is to ensure that the CLI entry point (cli) runs smoothly and any exceptions are caught and handled gracefully.
**parameters**: This function does not accept any parameters directly.

**Code Description**: 
The `safe_entry_point` function serves as a safety mechanism for the command-line interface (CLI) tool. Its primary role is to call the `cli()` function, which acts as the main entry point for the CLI interface of the duckduckgo_search tool. If an exception occurs during the execution of `cli()`, `safe_entry_point` catches it and prints a user-friendly error message that includes both the type of the exception and its description.

Here is a detailed analysis:

- **Purpose**: The purpose of `safe_entry_point` is to provide robustness to the CLI tool by handling unexpected errors. This ensures that even if an unhandled exception occurs within `cli()`, the program does not crash, maintaining a smooth user experience.
  
- **Functionality**:
  - It attempts to execute the `cli()` function.
  - If any exception is raised during the execution of `cli()`, it catches the exception and prints a message using `click.echo`.
  - The printed message includes both the type of the exception (`type(ex).__name__`) and its description (`ex`), which helps in understanding the nature of the error.

- **Relationship with Callees**:
  - **cli**: The `safe_entry_point` function calls the `cli()` function. This relationship is crucial because any logic or functionality implemented within `cli()` will be executed under the protection provided by `safe_entry_point`. If `cli()` encounters an issue, it can be gracefully handled without disrupting the overall program flow.
  - **click**: The `click.echo` function from the `click` library is used to print the error message. This ensures that the output is formatted in a way that is consistent with other CLI tools and user-friendly.

- **Testing Considerations**:
  - Although not directly tested within this function, any tests for `cli()` should be robust enough to cover various scenarios where exceptions might occur.
  - The `safe_entry_point` function indirectly contributes to the overall testability of the CLI tool by ensuring that errors are handled gracefully and reported clearly.

- **Note**: Ensure that all dependencies required by `cli()` are properly imported and configured. This includes any commands or options that users can input through the command line, as well as their validation logic.

By using `safe_entry_point`, developers ensure that the CLI tool is more resilient to unexpected errors, enhancing its reliability and user experience.
## FunctionDef version
**version**: The function of version is to print and return the current version of the DuckDuckGo CLI tool.
**parameters**: 
· None

**Code Description**: 
The `version` function simply prints out the value stored in the `__version__` variable, which holds the current version number of the DuckDuckGo CLI. It then returns this same value. This is a common practice for software tools to provide a way to check their version at runtime.

```python
def version():
    # Print the version information
    print(__version__)
    
    # Return the version as a string
    return __version__
```

- The function starts by printing `__version__` using the built-in `print()` function. This outputs the current version to the console, which can be useful for debugging or providing users with the exact version of the software they are running.
- After printing, the function returns the same value stored in `__version__`. The return statement ensures that this version information is available programmatically as well.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that the `__version__` variable is properly defined and set before calling the `version()` function. This can be done in another part of your code or by setting it directly.
- If you are using this function in a script, make sure to either import the module containing the `version` function or call it within the same file where `__version__` is defined.

**Output Example**: 
If the current version of the DuckDuckGo CLI tool is "1.0.2", running the `version()` function would result in the following output:

```
1.0.2
```

- **sessionToken**: A unique token generated for each active session to maintain user authentication status.
  - **Type:** String
  - **Purpose:** To track the current session of a logged-in user, ensuring that only authorized actions can be performed during this period.

- **lastLoginTime**: The timestamp indicating when the user last accessed the system.
  - **Type:** DateTime
  - **Purpose:** To monitor and log the activity of users for security purposes and to manage inactivity timeouts.

**Methods:**

- **authenticateUser(username, password):**
  - **Description:** Validates a user's credentials by comparing the provided username and password with stored values.
  - **Parameters:**
    - `username`: The username entered by the user during login (String)
    - `password`: The plain-text password entered by the user (String)
  - **Returns:**
    - If successful, returns a session token (String) that can be used to maintain the user’s session.
    - If unsuccessful, returns null.

- **logoutUser(sessionToken):**
  - **Description:** Ends an active user session by invalidating the provided session token.
  - **Parameters:**
    - `sessionToken`: The unique identifier for the current session (String)
  - **Returns:**
    - Boolean value indicating whether the logout was successful.

- **updateLastLoginTime(sessionToken):**
  - **Description:** Updates the last login timestamp for a given user session.
  - **Parameters:**
    - `sessionToken`: The unique identifier for the current session (String)
  - **Returns:**
    - Boolean value indicating whether the update was successful.

**Usage Example:**

```python
# Authenticate a user and retrieve their session token
token = UserAuthentication.authenticateUser('john_doe', 'securepassword123')
if token:
    print(f"Login successful. Session Token: {token}")
else:
    print("Invalid credentials.")

# Log out the user using their session token
logout_status = UserAuthentication.logoutUser(token)
print(f"Logout status: {'Success' if logout_status else 'Failed'}")

# Update the last login time for an active session
update_status = UserAuthentication.updateLastLoginTime(token)
print(f"Last login time updated: {'Success' if update_status else 'Failed'}")
```

**Best Practices:**
- Always use HTTPS to secure communication between client and server when handling authentication.
- Implement rate limiting on the `authenticateUser` method to prevent brute-force attacks.
- Regularly rotate session tokens to enhance security.

- **authenticate(username, password)**
  - Description: Authenticates a user based on provided credentials.
  - Parameters:
    - `username`: The username of the user attempting authentication.
      - Type: String
    - `password`: The password or its hash for the user.
      - Type: String
  - Returns:
    - `true` if authentication is successful, otherwise `false`.
  - Example Usage:
    ```javascript
    const result = UserAuthentication.authenticate("john_doe", "$2b$12$abcdeFGHIJKLmnopqrstuvwxyz");
    ```

- **generateToken(user)**
  - Description: Generates an authentication token for a given user.
  - Parameters:
    - `user`: The user object containing necessary information to generate the token.
      - Type: Object
  - Returns:
    - A string representing the generated token.
  - Example Usage:
    ```javascript
    const token = UserAuthentication.generateToken({ id: "1234567890abcdef", username: "john_doe" });
    ```

- **validateToken(token)**
  - Description: Validates an authentication token to check if the session is still active.
  - Parameters:
    - `token`: The authentication token to be validated.
      - Type: String
  - Returns:
    - `true` if the token is valid, otherwise `false`.
  - Example Usage:
