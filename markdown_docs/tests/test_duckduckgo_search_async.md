## FunctionDef pause_between_tests
**pause_between_tests**: The function of pause_between_tests is to introduce a 0.5-second delay between tests.

**parameters**: This Function has no parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The `pause_between_tests` function uses the built-in `time.sleep(0.5)` method to introduce a half-second (0.5 seconds) delay in the execution of the test script. This pause can be useful for several reasons:
- **Testing Stability and Consistency**: Introducing short delays between tests helps ensure that each test runs independently without interference from the previous one, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations or network requests.
- **Debugging and Logging**: By pausing briefly between tests, it becomes easier to observe the state of the application at different points in time, which can aid in debugging and logging issues.

**Note**: 
- Ensure that this function is used appropriately within a test suite to avoid unnecessary delays. Excessive use or long delays could impact the overall execution speed of your tests.
- Be aware that while `time.sleep` is a simple way to introduce pauses, it might not be suitable for all scenarios, such as when dealing with complex asynchronous operations where more precise timing control may be necessary.
