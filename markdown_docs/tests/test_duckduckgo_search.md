## FunctionDef pause_between_tests
**pause_between_tests**: The function of pause_between_tests is to introduce a short delay between test executions.
**Parameters**: This function does not take any parameters.

**Code Description**: 
The `pause_between_tests` function uses Python's built-in `time.sleep(0.5)` method to pause the execution of the program for 0.5 seconds (half a second) between each test case. This is particularly useful in scenarios where tests need to be spaced out slightly to avoid overwhelming the system or to ensure that resources are adequately released and reloaded between test runs.

The `time.sleep()` function suspends the execution of the current thread for a specified number of seconds, which in this case is 0.5 seconds. This pause can help in debugging by providing a clear separation between tests, making it easier to observe the state changes or responses after each test.

**Note**: Ensure that the delay is appropriate for your testing environment and does not introduce unnecessary delays that could impact the overall test execution time or resource management. Adjust the duration if necessary based on specific requirements.
